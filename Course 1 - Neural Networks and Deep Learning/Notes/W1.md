## The Big Picture: Why Deep Learning?

- AI is described as the new electricity.
- Just as electricity transformed industries like transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, and communication, AI is poised to have a similar widespread impact.
- Deep learning enables machines to automatically learn complex patterns from data.

## What is a Neural Network?

- A neural network is a system of mathematical functions that learns to map input data to output labels or values.
- Example: Predicting housing prices based on features like:
  - Size of the house
  - Number of bedrooms
  - Zip code
  - Area wealth

## Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

Common applications and their input/output mappings:

| Input                              | Output                  | Example Application         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Home features                      | Price                   | Real Estate                 |
| Ad and user profile                | Click? (0 or 1)         | Online Advertising          |
| Image                              | Object label            | Photo Tagging               |
| Audio waveform                     | Text transcript         | Speech Recognition          |
| English text                       | Translated text         | Machine Translation         |
| Image and sensor data              | Positions of cars       | Autonomous Driving          |

## Neural Network Architectures

- Standard Neural Networks: Work with structured tabular data.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Effective for image data.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Suited for sequence data like text or time series.

## Structured vs Unstructured Data

Structured data examples (tables):

Size | Bedrooms | Price ($1000s)

2104 | 3 | 400

1600 | 3 | 330

Unstructured data examples:

- Images
- Text (e.g., "Four score and seven years ago…")
- Audio recordings

## Why is Deep Learning Taking Off Now?

Three primary drivers:

- Access to large datasets
- Powerful computational resources (e.g., GPUs/TPUs)
- Improvements in learning algorithms

Key observation: Performance increases with more data and compute power.
